## Learning Roadmap
1. Basics: Syntax, control flow, operators (Task_01–Task_05)
2. Strings & Data Structures: Strings, lists, tuples, dicts (Task_03–Task_06)
3. Functions & OOP: Functions, classes, inheritance (Task_07–Task_09)
4. Advanced Python: File handling, exceptions, decorators, generators (Task_10–Task_12)

### Next Steps (after advanced Python):

1. Numpy, Pandas
2. Data visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
3. SQL, EDA, ML fundamentals (as per program curriculum)
